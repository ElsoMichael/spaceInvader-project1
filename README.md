## Development

Space Invader! I know its not a very Original Name. But its my take on a simple version of Galaga. This is for my First Project for IronHack! Collision with Firing is the biggest issue i faced making this game! But at the end of the day i got it to all work and i hope you enjoy it!!!!

Also a Big Thanks to My Classmates, Teacher and TA's for the help with my code!
